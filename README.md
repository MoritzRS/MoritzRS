# Hi there, I'm Moritz üëã

## About Me

I'm a **Software Engineer / Web Developer** with a passion for solving problems and building things.
With over 3 years of experience in web development, I've already had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects across frontend and backend.
My Expertise lies in analyzing challenges, designing tools that streamline processes and conceptualizing products.
I am always eager to learn new things and improve my skills.

### Professional Experience

- **Most Recent Role:** Software Engineer / Web Developer at [rooom AG](https://www.rooom.com)
- **Past Experience:** Short stint at Telekom MMS, primarily focused on web technologies and user tracking.
- **Internships:** During my studies I worked at Intershop Communications AG
- **Education:** Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Applied Sciences in Schmalkalden.

### What I Do

- **Languages:** I mainly use _JavaScript/TypeScript_ for development, with _Python_ being my second go-to language.
  However, I enjoy picking up any language or tool that helps get the job done quickly and effectively, including _PHP_, _Dart_, _Rust_, _C++_, etc.
- **Frameworks & Tools:** I'm a big fan of _Svelte_, and I have experience with _FastAPI_, _NestJS_, and _Docker_.
  I regularly interact with a variety of tools and frameworks, adapting to the needs of each project.
- **Databases:** I typically use _SQLite_ or _PostgreSQL_ when I need a database in my projects.
- **CI/CD:** I have some experience with _Docker_ and _GitHub Actions_ for deploying and testing projects. I use _Coolify_ and _GitLab pipelines_ at work.
- **Design:** I have a very basic understanding of _UI_ and _UX_ Design which helps me to spot and improve usability issues.
- **Operating Systems:** I'm most comfortable with _Linux_ but am also familiar with _Windows_ and _MacOS_.

### Work Methodologies

- **Team Workflow:** I have some experience with _Scrum_ practices in an agile team.
- **Solo Workflow:** When I'm alone in project, I tend to use _Kanban_ to stay organized and get things done.
- **Workshops & Meetings:** I have some minimal experience in organizing and leading workshops and meetings.
- **Note-Taking:** I like to take notes. I use my _Supernote_ alongside _Obsidian_ to keep track of my thoughts and ideas.
